# Fullstack monorepo template feat. Expo, Turbo, Next.js, Convex, Clerk

This is a modern TypeScript monorepo template with AI web and native apps
featuring:

- Turborepo: Monorepo management
- Next.js 14: Web app & marketing page
- React Native [Expo](https://expo.dev/): Mobile/native app
- [Convex](https://convex.dev): Backend, database, server functions
- [Clerk](https://clerk.dev): User authentication
- OpenAI: Text summarization (optional)

The example app is a note taking app that can summarize notes using AI. Features
include:

- Marketing page
- Dashboard page (web & native)
- Note taking page (web & native)
- Backend API that serves web & native with the same API
- Relational database
- End to end type safety (schema definition to frontend API clients)
- User authentication
- Asynchronous call to an OpenAI
- Everything is realtime by default

## Using this example

### 1. Install dependencies

If you don't have `yarn` installed, run `npm install --global yarn`.

Run `yarn`.

### 2. Configure Convex

> Note: The following command will print an error and ask you to add the
> appropriate environment variable to proceed. Continue reading on for how to do
> that.

```sh
npm run setup --workspace packages/backend
```

The script will log you into Convex if you aren't already and prompt you to
create a project (free). It will then wait to deploy your code until you set the
environment variables in the dashboard.

Configure Clerk with [this guide](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk). Then add
the `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` found in the "convex" template
[here](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates), to your
Convex environment variables
[here](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/settings/environment-variables&var=CLERK_ISSUER_URL).

Make sure to enable **Google and Apple** as possible Social Connection
providers, as these are used by the React Native login implementation.

After that, optionally add the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var from
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to your Convex
environment variables to get AI summaries.

The `setup` command should now finish successfully.

### 3. Configure both apps

In each app directory (`apps/web`, `apps/native`) create a `.env.local` file
using the `.example.env` as a template and fill out your Convex and Clerk
environment variables.

- Use the `CONVEX_URL` from `packages/backend/.env.local` for
  `{NEXT,EXPO}_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`.
- The Clerk publishable & secret keys can be found
  [here](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).

### 4. Run both apps

Run the following command to run both the web and mobile apps:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will allow you to use the ⬆ and ⬇ keyboard keys to see logs for each
of the Convex backend, web app, and mobile app separately.
If you'd rather see all of the lod gs in one place, delete the
`"ui": "tui",` line in [turbo.json](./turbo.json).

## What's inside?

This monorepo template includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: a [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) app with TailwindCSS and Clerk
- `native`: a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app built with
  [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)
- `packages/backend`: a [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) folder with the
  database schema and shared functions

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

To install a new package, `cd` into that directory, such as [packages/backend](./packages/backend/), and then run `yarn add mypackage@latest`

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) for native development
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

# What is Convex?

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is a hosted backend platform with a built-in
database that lets you write your
[database schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) and
[server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions) in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/typescript). Server-side database
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) automatically
[cache](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#caching--reactivity)
and [subscribe](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#reactivity) to data,
powering a
[realtime `useQuery` hook](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#fetching-data)
in our [React client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react). There are also
clients for [Python](https://docs.convex.dev/client/python),
[Rust](https://docs.convex.dev/client/rust),
[ReactNative](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react-native), and
[Node](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript), as well as a straightforward
[HTTP API](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-js/blob/main/src/browser/http_client.ts#L40).

The database supports
[NoSQL-style documents](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-storage) with
[relationships](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids) and
[custom indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/indexes/) (including on fields
in nested objects).

The [`query`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) and
[`mutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) server
functions have transactional, low latency access to the database and leverage
our [`v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) with
[determinism guardrails](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#using-randomness-and-time-in-queries-and-mutations)
to provide the strongest ACID guarantees on the market: immediate consistency,
serializable isolation, and automatic conflict resolution via
[optimistic multi-version concurrency control](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ)
(OCC / MVCC).

The [`action` server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) have
access to external APIs and enable other side-effects and non-determinism in
either our [optimized `v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes)
or a more
[flexible `node` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime).

Functions can run in the background via
[scheduling](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) and
[cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs).

Development is cloud-first, with
[hot reloads for server function](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server)
editing via the [CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/cli). There is a
[dashboard UI](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard) to
[browse and edit data](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/data),
[edit environment variables](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables),
[view logs](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs),
[run server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/functions),
and more.

There are built-in features for
[reactive pagination](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination),
[file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage),
[reactive search](https://docs.convex.dev/text-search),
[https endpoints](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) (for
webhooks),
[streaming import/export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/), and
[runtime data validation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#validators)
for [function arguments](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/args-validation) and
[database data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#schema-validation).

Everything scales automatically, and it’s
[free to start](https://www.convex.dev/plans).
